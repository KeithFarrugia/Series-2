Series 2:
	Refactoring Duplication Metric / changing it to report the detected clones and their locations 
	
	Adding a way to parse the AST for duplicated clones (II)
		1. Normalise AST (replace all var names with ID, method with MTH, literal values with LIT etc) and strip comments/annotations
			2. Compute a hash for each subtree (where loc.end-loc.start >= 6)
			3. Group AST subtrees with identical hashes with bucket size >= 2 == TYPE II Clone
		
			2. Make a tree edit distance function (between two subtrees)
			3. Compare with all subtrees (similarity >= 70%)

TODO:
    1. Fix issues in Type2.rsc:
        a. Use line count 
        b. Use sets to take care of uniqueness

    2. Tree edit distance for nodes for Type III

    3. What the fuck to do for Type IV
